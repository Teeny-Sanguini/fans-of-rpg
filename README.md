# fans-of-rpg
This is basically a website that shows my love of RPGs and a little bit about myself.

# motivation
I wanted to create a space where people who are fans of RPGs can join in and showcase their love of RPGs.

#code style
Basically, I wrote this website purely in HTML & CSS. I'm still trying to think about how to incorporate Javascript in the website.

#contribute
You can contribute to the project by writing your answers in this format:
Name: <Your name>
Hometown: <Your hometown>
Favorite RPG/RPG series: <Your favorite RPG and/or RPG series>
If I were to be in an RPG my class would be: <your class>
